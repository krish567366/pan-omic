## BACKGROUND

### Field of Invention

This invention relates to computational consciousness modeling, specifically to systems and methods for quantifying consciousness emergence from biological data using unified theoretical frameworks.

### Prior Art

3. **No Quantitative Implementation**: No working systems exist that can compute consciousness metrics from biological data
4. **Scale Limitations**: Current approaches focus on single scales rather than multi-scale biological integration

### Problems Addressed

- Integration of multiple consciousness theories into unified computational framework
- Quantitative consciousness measurement from biological data
- Multi-scale biological system modeling for consciousness emergence
- Real-time consciousness metric computation
